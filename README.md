# Stock-Management-System-using-Java
The Stock Management System we will build will be a simple console-based application that allows users to add, remove and view all the available stocks and their amount. We have used inbuilt classes ArrayList and Scanner. ArrayList is for storing the stocks while Scanner class is for taking the output from user through keyboard.Our program consists of two classes named as StockManagementSystem and Stock. Stock class has all the getters and setters for stock name, quantity, and price. It also has method for removing stock with condition of quantity to remove is less than available quantity. Stock management system class has main method. It has switch case inside do while loop. There are four options will appear as – Add stock, Remove stock, View stock and Exit. For adding stock user need to give stock name, quantity, and price. ‘Add’ function of ArrayList has been used to add stocks in record. Removal of stock is taken place by its name. If stock is available in record then it will be removed on the given quantity provided by user. We have simply called the method to remove which we have coded in Stock class.  For displaying stocks for each loop has been used which will print stock name with it’s quantity and price. Breaking the loop will make user exits from the system. Basic OOPS concepts are making this system easy to code and understand. Happy Coding!

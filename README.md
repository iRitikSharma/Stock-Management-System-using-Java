# Stock-Management-System-using-Java
The Stock Management System we will build will be a simple console-based application that allows users to add, remove and view all the available stocks and their amount. We have used inbuilt classes ArrayList and Scanner. ArrayList is for storing the stocks while Scanner class is for taking the output from user through keyboard.
